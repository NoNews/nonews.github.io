Hi.

Iâ€™m Alexey, Android Software Engineer based in London.

<br>I work at Revolut, where I take care for a platform-specific domain: Build time, CI/CD, testing tools and common approaches & processes.
<br>Prevously, I was working at Kaspresky.

I got into software development thanks to people who are actively sharing knowledge by blog posts and free courses. 
<br>This is why I spend a lot of my spare time sharing content with the community, and I have incredible fun doing it!
In 2018, I laid the basics of Android Academy community in Moscow, which currently has more than a thousand people, who are educated for free.

Advocate of Kotlin, functional programming, Jetpack Compose & testing.
