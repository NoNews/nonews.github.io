Hi.

Iâ€™m Alexey, Android Software Engineer & GDE based in London.

<br>I work at Revolut where I take care of a platform-specific domain and developer experience: Build time & Gradle, CI/CD, Testing tools and common approaches & processes.

I got into software development thanks to people who are actively sharing knowledge by blog posts and free courses. 
<br>This is why I spend a lot of my spare time sharing content with the community, and I have incredible fun doing it!
<br>In 2018, I organized Android Academy community in Moscow, which currently has more than a thousand people, who are educated for free.

Advocate of Kotlin, functional programming, Jetpack Compose & UI testing.
